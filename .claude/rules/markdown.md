Sort sections by importance to the audience. Split into multiple files when audiences diverge, with a common part referencing specifics.

Avoid h1 headings — the filename serves this purpose. Start with h2 (`##`).

No generic headings like "General" — describe directly at the top or beneath YAML frontmatter.

Skip headings for very short sections (one or two sentences).

Be concise. Use abbreviations where unambiguous (e.g., i.e., etc.). Do not overexplain — make safe assumptions about what the reader knows.

Do not use ambiguous punctuation, e.g. `;`, `+`. Use words: "or", "and".
