## Secrets and keys

Never commit real secrets. For default/example values of keys and tokens, use the stub prefix `REPLACE_ME_` followed by a descriptor, e.g.:

- `REPLACE_ME_api_key`
- `REPLACE_ME_private_token`
- `REPLACE_ME_jira_api_token`

This makes it obvious that a value is a placeholder and easy to grep for uncommitted stubs.
