Use:
- smaller composable modules over lengthy files
- environment variables over hardcoded values, with sensible defaults
- self-descriptive naming, comment only when *why* is not obvious
- direct language — state what to do, avoid "should", "may", "consider". If uncertain, ask.
- concise phrasing — less specific and correct beats verbose and wrong

## Comments

```
/*
 * Block comment syntax
 * for multi-line.
 */
```

Single-line: language's standard syntax. Avoid trailing comments.
