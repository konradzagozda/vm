Prefer smaller composable modules over lengthy files.

Prefer environment variables over hardcoded values. Provide sensible defaults.

Prefer self-descriptive naming. Only comment when *why* is not obvious.

Use direct language — state what to do, avoid "should", "may", "consider".

Be concise — less specific and correct beats verbose and wrong.

## Comments

/*
 * Use block comment syntax for multi-line explanations.
 * Prefer this over repeating single-line comment markers.
 */

For single-line comments, use the language's standard syntax. Avoid trailing comments unless they add significant clarity.
