## Modularity

Prefer smaller composable modules over lengthy files.

## Defaults

Prefer environment variables over hardcoded values. Always provide sensible defaults.

## Comments

/*
 * Use block comment syntax for multi-line explanations.
 * Prefer this over repeating single-line comment markers.
 */

For single-line comments, use the language's standard single-line syntax. Only comment *why*, not *what* — the code should be self-explanatory. Avoid trailing comments unless they add significant clarity.
